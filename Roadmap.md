### **III. Industry Pain Points and Solutions**  

#### **1. Real Market Challenges**  
- **Cost Black Hole**: AWS and other cloud services account for **62%** of ZK-Rollup project computing costs, with a markup exceeding **400%**.  
- **Resource Waste**: Global smart devices generate **5 billion TFlops·h** of idle computing power daily (equivalent to 50,000 AWS p4d clusters).  
- **Centralization Risk**: A 2023 AWS outage froze **$120M** in on-chain assets (CoinDesk).  

#### **2. DPN's Breakthrough Solutions**  
| **Dimension** | **Traditional Solutions' Flaws** | **DPN's Solutions** |  
|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|

### **IV. Technical Architecture: Balancing Algorithms and Engineering**  

#### **1. Dynamic Price Anchoring Model (DAM)**  
**Formula Design**:  
\[ P_t = P_{base} \times \left(1 + \alpha \times \frac{D_t - S_t}{S_t}\right) \]  
- \( P_t \): Real-time computing price (USD/TFlops·h).  
- \( P_{base} \): Base cost (device depreciation + electricity, global weighted average of **$0.15/TFlops·h**).  
- \( \alpha = 0.05 \): Limits volatility to **±5%**.  
- \( D_t/S_t \): Real-time supply-demand ratio.  

**Anti-Volatility Mechanisms**:  
- **Reserve Pool Buffer**: Holds **5%** of computing power to handle sudden demand spikes, automatically managed by smart contracts.  
- **Excess Computing Redistribution**: When supply > 1.5x demand, redundant computing power is allocated to public research projects.  

#### **2. Device Layer Security Verification**  
- **Hardware Fingerprint**: Collects **12-dimensional physical features** (GPU voltage fluctuations, RAM latency, etc.), with machine learning models detecting fake devices (accuracy **>99.3%**).  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Each device generates a **zk-STARK proof** daily, with a verification cost of **<$0.0001** per task.  

#### **3. Development Roadmap (2025-2026)**  
| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Goals** | **Deliverables** |
