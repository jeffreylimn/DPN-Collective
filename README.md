# **DPN Collective**  
**Decentralized Physical Computing Network**  

---

## **Overview**  
The **DPN Collective** is an open-source initiative to build a decentralized physical computing network (DPN) that democratizes access to computing power. By leveraging idle resources from billions of devices worldwide, DPN aims to create a trustless, low-cost, and resilient alternative to centralized cloud services.  

This repository serves as the central hub for the DPN protocol's development, documentation, and community collaboration.  

---

## **Vision**  
To make computing power as accessible and affordable as electricity, enabling anyone to contribute, access, and benefit from a global decentralized computing network.  

---

## **Key Features**  
- **Tokenized Computing Power**: Every DPN token represents real, redeemable computing resources.  
- **Five-Dimensional Dynamic Anchoring**: A robust model that ensures fair pricing and stability.  
- **Anti-ASIC Design**: Prioritizes ordinary devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops) over specialized hardware.  
- **Decentralized Governance**: A community-driven approach to protocol upgrades and decision-making.

## **Whitepaper**  
The full technical and economic details of the DPN protocol are outlined in the **[DPN Whitepaper](https://github.com/jeffreylimn/DPN-Collective/blob/main/DPN-Whitepaper-v0.1.md)**.
