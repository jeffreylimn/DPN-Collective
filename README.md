# Decentralized Physical Computing Network (DPN)

## Project Overview
DPN is currently in the **conceptual and design phase**. Our mission is to reduce computational costs for Ethereum L2 by **35–40%** compared to traditional cloud services like AWS, while establishing a distributed network with over **5 million nodes**. This network will deliver enterprise-grade availability and make decentralized computing more accessible to everyone.

The goal of DPN is to make computing power as accessible as water and electricity, enabling everyone to participate in the future of decentralized computing and benefit from it. It achieves this by having each DPN correspond to real computing power, ensuring numerical stability, and allowing users and enterprises to freely exchange, use, or convert computing power, breaking the monopoly of traditional cloud services.

## Industry Advantages
Compared with existing solutions in the market, DPN has significant competitive advantages:
| Solution Type | Key Defects | Competitive Advantages of DPN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Centralized cloud services | Single - point - of - failure risk, markup of over 480% | Five - dimensional dynamic pricing, fault - tolerant nodes |
| Traditional distributed | 18% monthly node churn rate, latency > 30 milliseconds | Hardware fingerprint + VDF, stability > 99.9% |
| Tokenized computing | Volatility of over 90% in tokens, value decoupling | Five - dimensional anchoring model, deviation < 5% |

When compared with traditional computing power vendors, DPN also outperforms in multiple dimensions:
| Dimension | Traditional Computing Power Vendors | DPN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pricing model | Complex and opaque, monopoly premium | Five - dimensional dynamic anchoring, transparent and reasonable |
| Computing power conversion delay | Slow response, late refund of fees | Real - time response, no delay |
| Data security and privacy | Risks of leakage and abuse | Zero - knowledge proof to ensure privacy |
| Service quality | Uneven | 99.9% normal operation, global balance |
| Innovation freedom | Fixed and difficult to customize, slow response | Open - source and customizable, fast response |
| Anti - censorship | Vulnerable to policy impacts | Distributed deployment, strong anti - censorship |
| Marginal cost | Increases with scale | Approaches zero |

## Technical Architecture
### Optimization Framework for Device Heterogeneity
The optimization framework for device heterogeneity in DPN achieves 98% data availability. The heavy node layer (servers/smart cars) executes high - value tasks such as model training and improves efficiency through **asynchronous gradient updates**.

### Ethereum Synergy
- **Settlement layer**: DPN tokens are issued based on the ERC - 1400 standard and support low - cost settlement on the Ethereum L2 network (Optimism/Arbitrum), with transaction fees ≤ $0.01.
- **Account abstraction**: Achieve account abstraction through EIP - 4337. Users can use ETH to pay for DPN computing power fees without maintaining multiple - token wallets.

### Node Network Comparison with Ethereum Proof - of - Stake (PoS)
| Indicator | Ethereum Proof - of - Stake (PoS) | DPN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node access** | Stake 32 ETH | Permissionless device access |
| **Revenue source** | Block rewards + gas fees | Computing fees + burning subsidies |
| **Degree of decentralization** | Approximately 800,000 validators (2025 data) | Target: 5 million devices (2028) |

## Governance Architecture
DPN adopts a hierarchical governance model:
| Governance Level | Decision - Making Scope | Voting Weight Algorithm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 core layer | Protocol upgrade/anchoring parameters | Computing power contribution duration × 0.7+DPN staking amount × 0.3 |
| L2 ecosystem layer | Application scenarios/partners | One - person - one - vote (SBT identity verification) |
| L3 emergency layer | System meltdown/hacker response | 3/5 multi - signature committee |

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1: Validation (2025–2026)**  
  - Technical goals: The test network supports ZK - SNARK proof generation (compatible with Circom/R1CS), and integrate 1 million devices (focusing on game communities and data centers).
  - Milestones:
    - 2025Q4: Complete the deployment of the Optimism mainnet.
    - 2026Q2: The geographical distribution of nodes covers 50 countries.
- **Phase 2: Expansion (2027–2028)**  
  - Technical goals: Achieve cross - L2 computing scheduling (interoperability of Optimism/zkSync/StarkNet), and the node scale exceeds 5 million, meeting 50% of the computing needs of Ethereum L2.
  - Milestones:
    - 2027Q3: The quantum - safe upgrade (Lattice - BLS signature) is activated across the network.
    - 2028Q4: The satellite computing power cluster is connected for the first time.
- **Phase 3: Autonomy (2029+)**  
  - Technical goals: Completely transition to DAO governance, with the token burning rate ≥ issuance rate (deflationary stage), and support neural interfaces and quantum computing power access.
  - Milestones:
    - 2029Q1: The governance fund launches an AI agent pilot.
    - 2030Q4: The delay of the Earth - Moon computing power corridor is optimized to within 1 second.

## Security and Compliance
### Post - Quantum Implementation Roadmap
| Stage | Technical Goals | Completion Mark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025Q4 | Pre - install PQC algorithms in TEE chips | Apple M3 chip passes FIPS 140 - 3 certification |
| 2026Q2 | Lattice - BLS signatures are deployed across the network | Signature speed ≥ 1000 TPS |
| 2027Q1 | Quantum random number generator (QRNG) | Pass NIST SP 800 - 90B testing |

### Legal Architecture Mirroring
- Simultaneously register non - profit foundations in Switzerland, Singapore, and Wyoming.
- Create an on - chain legal entity through Aragon to automatically execute DAO resolutions.

### Dynamic Compliance Engine Architecture
DPN constructs a pluggable compliance framework to address multi - jurisdiction regulations:
```python
class ComplianceEngine:
    def __init__(self, jurisdiction):
        self.load_regulations(jurisdiction)  # Dynamically load local regulations

    def verify_transaction(self, user):
        zk_proof = generate_zkp(user.KYC_data)  # Zero - knowledge proof verification
        if check_AML(user.wallet) and zk_proof.valid:
            return True
        else:
            trigger_compliance_hold(user.funds)

# Example: EU user processing
eu_engine = ComplianceEngine("EU - MiCA")
eu_engine.verify_transaction(user123)
