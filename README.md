# Decentralized Physical Computing Network (DPN)

## Introduction

The **Decentralized Physical Computing Network (DPN)** is an innovative project that aims to harness the idle computing power of billions of smart devices worldwide, creating a decentralized infrastructure to support Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solutions. By integrating cryptographic proofs and game-theoretic mechanisms, DPN addresses the scalability and centralization challenges in today’s blockchain ecosystem.

## Project Overview

DPN is currently in the **conceptual and design phase**. Our mission is to reduce computational costs for Ethereum L2 by **35–40%** compared to traditional cloud services like AWS, while establishing a distributed network with over **5 million nodes**. This network will deliver enterprise-grade availability and make decentralized computing more accessible to everyone.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Price Anchoring**: An enhanced EIP-1559 BASEFEE model ensures compute price stability within **±5%**.
- **Hardware Fingerprint Authentication**: Combines TEE secure enclaves and VDF time-locks to thwart Sybil attacks, with an estimated attack cost of **$18,000 per node per day**.
- **Deflationary Token Model**: Ties compute consumption to token burns, anchoring value and promoting sustainability.

## Current Status

DPN is actively seeking funding to develop and test its core technologies. We are eager to connect with partners and investors who share our vision for a decentralized future. Interested in collaborating or exploring investment opportunities? Reach out to us at **[dpnprotocol@hotmail.com](mailto:dpnprotocol@hotmail.com)**.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1: Validation (2025–2026)**  
  Build a testnet for ZK-SNARK proof generation and onboard the first million devices.
- **Phase 2: Expansion (2027–2028)**  
  Introduce cross-L2 compute scheduling and scale the network to over 5 million nodes.
- **Phase 3: Autonomy (2029+)**  
  Transition to full DAO governance and establish a fully deflationary token model.
