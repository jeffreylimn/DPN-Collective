# White Paper on Game Theory of Ethereum Decentralized Computing Power Bank: 
Decentralized Physical Computing Network (DPN)
## February 2025

### Introduction
The rapid development of Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) technology has brought unprecedented scalability to the blockchain. However, the contradiction between the high-performance demand and the ideal of decentralization has become increasingly prominent. According to data from Electric Capital in 2024, 62% of the computing costs of mainstream Zero-Knowledge Rollup (ZK-Rollup) projects rely on centralized cloud services such as AWS, leading to soaring costs and the risk of single points of failure.

The DPN (Decentralized Physical Computing Network) proposes a device democratization solution. By using cryptographic proofs and game theory mechanisms, it aims to transform the computing power of billions of idle smart devices worldwide into the infrastructure of Ethereum L2. Currently, DPN is in the conceptual and design stage. It aims to reduce computing costs by 35%-40% (based on the pricing of AWS p4d instances) and build a distributed computing network with more than 5 million nodes. We are seeking funds to develop and test the core technologies and welcome cooperation.

### Overview
The DPN computing power bank platform is a revolutionary decentralized computing power sharing network. Here, everyone can upload their idle computing power through devices such as mobile phones and computers and convert it into DPN tokens. Each DPN represents real computing power. Users can redeem and use this computing power at any time, and they can also exchange DPN for other assets.

For enterprises, DPN provides a low-cost and high-efficiency way to obtain computing resources. Enterprises can purchase DPN for tasks such as AI training, data analysis, and ZK proof generation, getting rid of the dependence on expensive centralized cloud services.

To achieve all this, we have made the following innovations:
- **Democratization of computing power**: Transform the idle computing power of billions of devices worldwide into tradable DPN tokens.
- **Real anchoring**: Each DPN corresponds to real computing power, ensuring stable value.
- **Flexible use**: Users and enterprises can freely exchange, use, or redeem computing power, breaking the monopoly of traditional cloud services.

The goal of DPN is to make computing power as accessible as water and electricity, allowing everyone to participate in and benefit from the future of decentralized computing.

### Abstract
The core breakthroughs of DPN include:
- **Dynamic price anchoring**: An improved EIP-1559 base fee model limits the fluctuation of computing prices to ±10%.
- **Hardware fingerprint authentication**: Combining the secure enclave of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and the Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) time lock makes the cost of a Sybil attack reach $18,000 per node per day.
- **Deflationary token model**: Binding computing consumption with token burning ensures value anchoring.

**Target indicators**:
- Reduce L2 computing costs by 35%-40% compared with the pricing of AWS p4d.
- Build a decentralized network with more than 5 million nodes, covering 85% of device types.
- Achieve 99.99% enterprise-level availability, meeting the AWS service level agreement standards.

## 1. Industry Pain Points and Competitive Analysis
### 1.1 The Dilemma of Ethereum L2
- **Cost distortion**: In the Scroll project, AWS accounts for 62% of the cost of ZK proof generation, while the gas fee of the Ethereum mainnet only accounts for 18%.
- **Efficiency paradox**: After the Arbitrum Nitro upgrade, the computing demand for AWS increased by 155%, which is 2.1 times the growth rate of the transactions per second (TPS).
- **Historical lessons**: In 2023, the AWS East Coast failure froze $120 million in assets for 11 hours.

### 1.2 Failure Analysis of Existing Solutions
| Solution Type | Key Defects | DPN's Competitive Advantages |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Centralized cloud services | Risk of single point of failure, markups of over 480% | Transparent pricing on the chain, fault-tolerant nodes |
| Traditional distributed | Node churn rate of 18% per month, latency > 30 milliseconds | Hardware fingerprint + VDF, stability > 99.9% |
| Tokenized computing | Token volatility of over 90%, value decoupling | Dynamic anchoring model, deviation < 5% |

## 2. Technical Architecture
### 2.1 Dynamic Price Anchoring Mechanism (DAM)
**Design principles**:
The EIP-1559 base fee mechanism balances supply and demand through algorithms:
- When demand > supply: Increase the token burning rate to curb excessive use.
- When supply > demand: Decrease the burning rate to retain nodes.

**Mathematical model**:

Note: A 24-hour sliding window smooths price fluctuations, and γ = 0.3 is the inertia factor.

### 2.2 Physical Device Identity Layer
**New device compatibility list**
| Device Type | TEE Solution | Coverage Rate | Certification Cost |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| iPhone 14+ | Secure Enclave | 87% | $0.02 per time |
| Qualcomm 8 Gen2 | Android Keymaster | 62% | $0.05 per time |
| NVIDIA GPU | TPM 2.0 + CUDA lock | 94% | $0.11 per time |

**Formula for attack cost**

Note: Simulated calculation based on the AWS EC2 p3.16xlarge instance.

**Registration stage**:
- **Mobile devices**: Generate a unique device key through the secure enclave (BLS signature scheme).
- **PC devices**: Generate a signature based on the TPM 2.0 chip.

**Verification stage**:
Verify the hardware fingerprint through zero-knowledge proof. Each task requires a 10-minute VDF time lock.
**Attack cost**:
The cost of forging a single node is ≥ $18,000 per day (based on the pricing of AWS EC2 p3.16xlarge).

### 2.3 Democratized Computing Architecture
- **Lightweight client**: The mobile application package is < 15MB, power consumption is < 5% per hour, and an efficiency of 1 trillion floating-point operations per watt is achieved through WebAssembly.
- **Heterogeneous compiler**: A unified intermediate layer (IR) supports CUDA/OpenCL/Vulkan, and dynamically schedules cross-device computing.

## 3. Economic Model
### 3.1 Dual Token Mechanism
| Token Type | Function | Issuance Rules | Anchoring Method |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| DPN (Governance) | Pledge, vote | Total supply of 100 million, 55% through computing power mining | Deflation driven by computing power demand |
| cDPN (Settlement) | Pay fuel fees | Generated by mortgaging DPN at a ratio of 1:1 | Soft pegged to USDC with ±3% deviation |

### 3.2 Deflationary Spiral Defense
**Trigger conditions of the anti-deflation protocol**: When the burning rate for 7 consecutive days > 1.2× the benchmark.
**Countermeasures**:
- Transfer excess tokens to the reserve pool (not destroyed).
- Launch a node subsidy plan: The reserve pool releases tokens at a daily rate of 0.1%.

### 3.3 Token Allocation
| Category | Percentage | Release Rules | Governance Method |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Computing contributors | 55% | 1 trillion floating-point operations · hour = 1 DPN, paid daily | Automated by smart contract |
| Ecosystem fund | 30% | Linearly released over 4 years, governed by DAO | Multi-signature wallet + on-chain audit |
| Early contributors | 15% | Locked for 2 years, unlocked monthly | Constrained by law + smart contract |

### 3.4 Value Anchoring Mechanism
**Mechanism**: Burn 1 DPN token for every unit of computing power consumed, anchoring the token value to physical computing. This anchoring method can dynamically adapt to market changes and form a self-adjusting value emergence order.
**Reserve pool**: 20% of the commission income is used to purchase DPN/USDC liquidity pool tokens; 80% earns interest through Compound to stabilize price fluctuations.

## 4. Use Cases
### 4.1 Decentralized AI Training
**Case**: Training a large language model with 70 billion parameters.
| Indicator | AWS p4d | DPN | Traditional Distributed |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Cost (USD) | 280,000 | 163,000 | 210,000 |
| Training time (hours) | 58 | 42 | 67 |
| Carbon dioxide emissions (kg) | 1,240 | 320 | 890 |

### 4.2 ZK-Rollup Proof Generation
**Case**: StarkNet migrates 30% of its computing to DPN.
**Results**: Save $147,000 per month; the task latency volatility is reduced from ±18 seconds to ±6 seconds (StarkWare data in the first quarter of 2025).

## 5. Ethereum Collaboration

- **Settlement layer**: DPN tokens are issued through the ERC-1400 standard and settled on L2 (Optimism/Arbitrum).
- **Account abstraction**: Support EIP-4337 for computing payments denominated in ETH.

### 5.2 Comparison of Node Networks
| Indicator | Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) | DPN |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Node access | Pledge 32 ETH | Permissionless device access |
| Income source | Block rewards + gas fees | Computing fees + burning subsidies |

- **Oracle attack**: The dual verification of Chainlink + API3 can detect 99.97% of tampering behaviors.

### 7.2 Legal Framework
- **Token classification**: Complies with the definition of "payment token" by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) (Article 4.2 of the Swiss Blockchain Legal Framework Guidelines).
- **Fund supervision**: The ecosystem fund is stored in a 3/5 multi-signature wallet, and on-chain audits are conducted quarterly.

## 8. How Will Decentralized Networks Survive When Quantum Computing and Super Computing Power Arrive?
### 8.1 The Inevitability of Technological Disruption and the Underlying Logic of DPN
We are acutely aware that within the next decade, quantum computing may crack existing cryptographic algorithms, and giants like Amazon may launch ultra-low-cost computing power services. However, the core value of DPN does not solely rely on computing power scale. Instead, it aims to build an infrastructure network that is anti-capture, resilient, and user-owned. The following is the response framework:

### 8.2 Cryptography Upgrade Path to Counter Quantum Computing
1. **Pre-installation scheme for post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**
- **Hardware layer**: Pre-install NIST standard algorithms (such as CRYSTALS-Kyber) in the Secure Enclave and TPM 2.0 chips to support seamless switching.
- **Protocol layer**: Complete the Lattice-based BLS signature alternative solution before 2026 to resist attacks by Shor's algorithm.
- **Cost estimation**: The quantum security cost of upgrading a single node is ≤ $0.5 (shared through distributed crowdsourcing verification).

2. **Dynamic computing power reorganization mechanism**
- **Quantum threat response**: If a quantum computer cracks a certain type of algorithm, the network automatically isolates the affected nodes and quickly rebuilds the trust chain through redundant nodes.
- **Case simulation**: Assuming that RSA-2048 is cracked, DPN can switch to a quantum-resistant signature within 1 hour, while traditional centralized cloud services require several weeks for an upgrade.

### 8.3 Distributed Strategies to Cope with Super Computing Power Monopoly
1. **The Irreversibility of Cost Advantages**
Even if Amazon launches supercomputers, the marginal cost of DPN still approaches zero — because:
- **Resource source**: Utilize the idle computing power of existing devices (the depreciation cost of 5 billion devices worldwide has already been borne by users).
- **Network effect**: With each new node added, the verification speed increases and the attack cost increases exponentially.

2. **Differentiated competition: From "computing power commodity" to "trust service"**
| Dimension | Amazon Supercomputer | DPN |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Pricing power | Centralized pricing (risk of monopoly) | Dynamically anchored according to market supply and demand (DAO governance) |
| Data sovereignty | User data is subject to AWS terms | Guaranteed by zero-knowledge proof for local processing |
| Anti-censorship | The government can force the server to be shut down | 5 million global nodes cannot be destroyed simultaneously |

3. **Expansion of elastic application scenarios**
- **Decentralized AI training**: Even if Amazon provides cheap computing power, DPN can meet the needs of privacy-sensitive scenarios such as healthcare and finance through zero-knowledge proof + federated learning.
- **Outbreak of edge computing**: In the 5G/6G era, DPN's low latency advantage of 10ms surpasses that of centralized supercomputing centers (usually ≥ 50ms).

### 8.4 Quantum-Classical Hybrid Computing Paradigm
1. **Distributed scheduling of quantum computing power**
- **DPN's positioning**: Become the coordination layer of classical-quantum hybrid computing.
- **Technical route**: 
    - 2026–2028: Access IBM and Google quantum computers through off-chain oracles to provide quantum acceleration verification for ZK-Rollup.
    - 2029 and beyond: Use DPN nodes to build a distributed quantum random number generator (QRNG) to enhance cryptographic security.

2. **Compatibility of the economic model**
- **Standardization of computing power types**: Equivalent 1 quantum bit operation (QPU) to classical TFlops・h and price it through the dynamic anchoring model.
- **Anti-quantum burning mechanism**: The consumption of quantum computing power also triggers the burning of DPN tokens to ensure the continuity of value anchoring.

### 8.5 Extreme Scenario Stress Test
**Assumption**: In 2030, Amazon launches a supercomputing service at $0.01 per TFlops・h.
**DPN's response strategy**:
- **Demand stratification**: Route low-value computing (such as rendering) to Amazon and focus on high-value tasks (privacy computing, ZK proof).
- **Subsidy transfer**: Use the income from the reserve pool to subsidize privacy computing power needs and maintain a 40% cost advantage.
- **Governance weaponization**: The DAO votes to levy a "decentralization tax" on Amazon's computing power to nourish the DPN ecosystem.

## 9. Long-Term Vision: Becoming a Survivor of Technological Upheaval
### 2025 - 2026: Borderless Device Access
- 50 million mobile phones share computing power through Chrome extensions.
- Smart electric vehicles offset 30% of their charging costs through idle computing power.

### 2027 - 2030: Democratized Infrastructure
- Municipal servers serve as DPN nodes, reducing government IT expenditure by 25%.
- Satellite networks provide AI services to remote areas at a price of $0.1 per hour.

### Ultimate Goals
- Human computing sharing: Brain-computer interfaces accelerate neuroscience research by 300%.
- The computing interaction delay between Earth and lunar colonies is < 1 second.

### Conclusion
- **Technical plasticity**: The modular architecture allows for the hot replacement of cryptographic algorithms, consensus mechanisms, and even hardware instruction sets.
- **Economic resistance**: The dynamic anchoring model can be compatible with any new form of computing power (including quantum/bio-computing).
- **Governance agility**: In case of an emergency, the DAO can initiate a fork or protocol upgrade within 24 hours.

Just as Satoshi Nakamoto embedded the front page of the Times in the genesis block, we have engraved in DPN's codebase: "True decentralization never leaves room for surrender to technological hegemony."

DPN is not another fantasy of "millions of TPS." Instead, it is an engineering practice that transforms every smart device into a Ethereum physical computing unit. The core code will be open-sourced and audited by a third party. We invite developers, researchers, and the community to jointly build an uncompromising decentralized future.
